What was my motivation for this? 
-------------------
This project is based on a very popular productivity application. This project was made to increase productivity for users. You would work hard for 25min, then take a 5 min break and rinse and repeat. It's difficult for the average person to continously work on the same task without exhasting him/herself. This application gives you the necessary breaks you need to be the most productive individual you can be. I hope you enjoy it!
